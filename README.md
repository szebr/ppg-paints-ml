# ppg-paints-ml
project sponsored by ppg paints for course in machine learning at the university of pittsburgh

The code used for this course wasn't entirely mine and was used in a sponsorship, so I didn't make it public, but I wanted to put my final presentation on here to get a record of the work that I did.
